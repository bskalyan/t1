I have tried using StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler(), asynchronous methods, and timers. Please find the code below, which we tested. While the code is working, we do not observe the streaming effect. Could you please guide us on how to fix the streaming issue? So far, I have only observed the streaming effect when using a timer.
